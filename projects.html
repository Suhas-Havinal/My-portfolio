           <h4>Single phase MOSFET Inverter Using PWM Technique</h4>
           <p>
            The project was to make inverter using PWM technique. Inverter is device which converts DC to AC. Here we have PWM technique which is nothing but Pulse Width Modulation. 
            <p>In this project we have used Battery, four MOSFETs, MOSFET drivers, Arduino, transformer Oscilloscope and a load.</p>
            <p>Here a 12V battery is connected to the boost converter, boost converter boost the voltage and it is connected to MOSFET drivers. These MOSFET drivers are connected to MOSFETs. There are 4 MOSFETs, where 2 MOSFETs are connected in parallel. From a battery is connected to Arduino. </p>
            <p>The Arduino has timer which is set for 10ms each pulse. MOSFET drivers are connected to MOSFETs and are used to trigger the MOSFETs. During first half cycle MOSFETs will turn on(Q1) and other two MOSFETs will turn off(Q2). Then positive pulse is generated. During another half cycle, Q1 will turn off and Q2 will turn on, then negative pulse is generated. </p>
            <p>The output of the MOSFETs is connected to Centre tapped transformer. Output is taken out from the transformer. Waveforms are observed in the oscilloscope.</p>
